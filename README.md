## Data presented
Due to the massive amount of data, I decided to pull in only Jersey City data from May and June for 2018 and 2019. This will give us higher numbers during good weather months; one being a summer month. Please follow along with my [CityBike Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/regina.neitzey#!/vizhome/CityBike_15846743652260/20182019fromMayJune-JerseyCitydata). 

## Requested city maps
In the first story tab, you can see that popular start stations are almost the same as the popular end station with just some slight variance in numbers. This indicates that completed journeys for the day trend toward starting and ending at the same stations.  But, most individual journeys end at different stations than where they began along the way. This indicates that people are probably using them for directed transportation to complete an errand and not just for exercise or pleasure. Although in the second story tab, you can see that Saturday numbers rose significantly in June, probably due to summer bike rides just for pleasure or exercise. Is this due to the 30 minute limit between start and stop before more fees are incurred? Might it be profitable to create passes that include extended ride time to pull in the exercise community?

## Male/Female Ration Trends
Also seen in the second story tab; ridership generally begins lowest on Sunday, rising quite a bit each day to Wednesday and then slowly makes it's way back down. This is consistent for males and females alike. With such a difference from day to day during the week, the bikes do not appear to be part of riding to work or school every day, but just for errands that have put off to midweek. Of riders with a known gender, male riders made up about 71% of ridership, whereas females made up about 22% of ridership. There was a slight increase in female percentage of ridership from 2018 to 2019, but it was less than 1%. Male/female population ratio did not seem to have a relationship to the male/female ratio of riders per station. It would be in citibike's best interest to work on finding ways to market and foster to female riders. 

## User Type Popularity Trends
In the third story tab, the popularity of the Subscriber far exceeds the Customer user type. But, Customer ridership did go up in 2019 by over 53% in May and 81% in June from the previous year. This would indicate that more visitors are starting to ride bikes especially in the summer, likely for tourism or back home from college. Subscriber ridership dropped by over 10% in June of 2019 from the previous year. It would be interesting to look into the amount of people buying bikes in those areas now that the citibike program has been around for over six years with Subscriptions descending. Did the program encourage people to get their own and ride consistently? 

## Summary
There are some fairly evident trends in the data, such as popular stations, what gender makes up most of the ridership and which type of pass people prefer. But, the data also prompts some more research into other variables that may be affecting changes. A smaller subset of data was used for this analysis and would inspire one to bring in more data to see if the findings remain consistent.
